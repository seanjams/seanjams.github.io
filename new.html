      <p>They Key Wheel is a visualization of 7-tone musical scales that I discovered while doing mathematical research at UC Davis. The network of scales can be used by musicians to find cool new ways to change keys, see which chords belong to a given key, and see which keys contain a certain chord. So far, the Key Wheel has helped me find really interesting and non-obvious cycles of notes that can be used as jazz progressions.</p>

      <p>Scalar is a web application designed for guitarists and pianists. These two very commonly played instruments have really different visualizations, and sometimes it can be difficult to quickly transcribe a song on one of these instruments to the other. With Scalar, the user can select notes with the guitar or piano to hear them and see the same notes highlighted accross both instruments in all possible places.</p>
